# RiveScript-Go

## Introduction

This is a RiveScript interpreter library written for the Go programming
language. RiveScript is a scripting language for chatterbots, making it easy
to write trigger/response pairs for building up a bot's intelligence.

**This project is still under heavy development and is not ready yet!**

## Development Roadmap

Rough estimation of the current progress on RiveScript-Go:

- [x] `LoadFile`, `LoadDirectory` and parsing RiveScript document (AST)
- [x] Reading parsed data into bot's main memory
- [x] `SortReplies()` to sort the data in the bot's memory
  - [x] Topic inheritence/includes
- [x] `Reply()` to fetch a reply.
  - [x] Inbound message formatting and substitutions
  - [x] Preparing triggers for regular expression engine
  - [x] Handling `%Previous` responses
  - [x] Handling conditional responses
  - [x] Response tag processing
  - [x] Handling the BEGIN block
- [x] Sanity check the code by making sure everything in `testsuite.rive` works as expected
- [ ] Write all the miscellaneous config functions such as `SetUservar()`
- [ ] Make a standalone "shell" program for quickly testing the bot
- [ ] Unit tests to make sure it has feature parity with other implementations

## Installation

`go get github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go`

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    rivescript "github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go"
)

func main() {
    bot := rivescript.New()

    // Load a directory full of RiveScript documents (.rive files)
    bot.LoadDirectory("eg/brain")

    // Load an individual file.
    bot.LoadFile("brain/testsuite.rive")

    // Sort the replies after loading them!
    bot.SortReplies()

    // Get a reply.
    reply := bot.Reply("local-user", "Hello, bot!")
    fmt.Printf("The bot says: %s", reply)
}
```
